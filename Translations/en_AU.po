msgid "[vsync_mode_info]"
msgstr ""
"Synchronizes the frame rate of the game to your monitor to reduce tearing.\n"
"\n"
"Disabled - No Vsync, frames will be displayed as fast as possible, and the "
"frame rate is not limited to the refresh rate of the monitor.\n"
"[Pro: Reduced input lag. | Con: Increased likelhood of tearing at low frame "
"rates.]\n"
"\n"
"Enabled - Default Vsync, frames are synchronized with the monitor's refresh "
"rate to reduce tearing.\n"
"[Pro: Eliminates tearing completely. | Con: Introduces input lag as the game "
"has to wait to display each frame.]\n"
"\n"
"Adaptive Vsync - Vsync adapts to the frame rate, enabling Vsync when the "
"frame rate is below the refresh rate, and disabling it when the frame rate "
"exceeds the refresh rate to reduce input lag.\n"
"[Pro: Minimises input lag at higher frame rates. | Con: During varying frame "
"rates and switching, visual irregularities could appear.]\n"
"\n"
"Mailbox - A double-buffered implementation to minimise tearing, displays the "
"most recent frame when possible and does not limit frame rate.\n"
"[Pro: Reduces tearing significantly as frames are only displayed when the "
"monitor refreshes. | Con: Increased input lag compared to disabled.]"
